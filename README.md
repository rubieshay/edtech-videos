## About the App

This app was created for a challenge on 10Fold (https://app.10foldhiring.com/).

The goal was to create an EdTech platform for finding, viewing, and commenting on videos. This included requirements for displaying a list of videos, being able to create new videos, add and view comments, include video controls for volume and playback speed, and have fullscreen playback capability.

This app starts with a demo login screen, and is then broken down into two pages: *Learn* and *Content Studio*.

On the *Learn* page, users can view videos from a searched username, and click on one to watch. Then they are taken to the video page with the fully custom video player and comments section.

In the *Content Studio*, users can see videos they've uploaded and edit/delete existing videos or upload new videos.

While using the demo, you can search for user "rubie_shay" to view the provided sample videos, or login as "rubie_shay" to view them in *Content Studio*.


## Running the App

To run the app, open the directory and run the following commands:

1) npm install

2) npm run build

3) npm start

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the result.
